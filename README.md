# Maze-Solver
This is my Maze Solver. It reads a maze in a text file, and solves it, if there's way out, printing the path it made.

## How to Run it?
- Kotlin runs on jvm, which means java runtime is required to run it. 
- I recommend that you use a IDE with Kotlin support. If you can, use IntelliJ IDEA, which is built by the same company that created Kotlin.
- If you insist on using a plain editor and the command line, see https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html
- Have fun.

## What Can I Do?
- The program gives you some options during the execution.
- You can change some default chars by the ones you prefer. For example, you can change the entering default char from 'I' to 'E', just by changing it in the companion object inside Solver class.
- Explore it, enjoy!
